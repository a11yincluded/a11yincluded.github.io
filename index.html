						<p>A majority of websites have one or more accessibility issues. Before hiring a web accessibility professional to audit your website, you might consider testing your website with one of the following free tools to see if there are any accessibility issues present:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM's WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/">Deque Systems' axeâ„¢ Accessibility Browser Extensions</a></li>
						</ul>

						<p>If any issues are flagged, it may be time for you to hire a professional to audit your website.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Have your website audited by a web accessibility professional to determine what accessibility issues are present on the website. Make sure to request a detailed, technical list of the issues, as well as a list of details on how to resolve those issues.</li>

							<li>Contact a web developer (or web development team). Present them with the list of technical recommendations and inquire as to whether they can implement those recommendations on your website. If yes, request a quote. Once the quote is received, determine whether you have the budget to pay to resolve your website's accessibility issues.</li>

						<h3 id="faq--how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-website-accessible-heading">How much does it cost to make a website accessible?</h3>

						<p>The cost of making a website accessible can vary widely depending on the size and features of the website. Anecdotally, many accessibility experts believe that it's more expensive to "retrofit" accessibility onto an existing website than to build a website from scratch and include accessibility in the planning, design, and development of the website from the outset.</p>

						<p>At Accessibility Included, we offer Web Accessibility Audits starting at $500. From there, the additional cost of making your website accessible depends on the cost of the web development labour hired to implement the changes we recommend.</p>
